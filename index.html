            <h2>What's this?</h2>
            <p> It doesn't take much (when talkin' nuclear) to kill everything on the planet Earth.
            Here we've got the American stockpile of nuclear weapons (Megatons: BAM!) along with how
            the American public thought the current president was doin'. The small Earth (see @ left corner)
            shows just how much death America could potentially bring, yet the presidential approval seems
            indifferent if not skewed towards more bombs = higher % approval (I'm looking at you, '60 and '64). Does this say anything about how we think about national responsibility for death?
            Does it say nothing about us at all?</p>
