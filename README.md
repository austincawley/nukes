# nukes
A short and small homework assignment on the US nuclear stockpile.  
It uses [d3.js](http://www.d3js.org) to present perhaps a grim view of our potential infliction of death but I feel falls short in allowing insights.  
I am happy with the design.   
It lives online [here](http://personal.stevens.edu/~acawleye/nukes/index.html) through my school's personal space.
